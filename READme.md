# My ToDoList App

## Description
My ToDoList App is a simple webpage on which you can add your ToDos. As soon as you're done with a task, just set it as "checked". You can also delete them if you need to.

The aim was to put into practice my JavaScript and responsive knowledge.

Got help from this tutorial: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_todolist.asp.

## Technos
HTML, CSS, JS.
